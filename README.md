🎞️ Lens Flare Post Process Effect 
- Unreal Engine 5

Project Overview

This project is a realistic lens flare effect created as a custom post-process material in Unreal Engine 5. It mimics the optical phenomena seen in camera lenses when looking directly at bright light sources such as the sun, headlights, or explosions.

The effect works dynamically – a rainbow halo appears only when a strong light source is perfectly centered on the screen, simulating the behavior of real-world camera lenses.
